\chapter{Conclusion and future work}

Characterization summary
Combination of feature based and dense correspondence based optical flow. 

Future Work:
Divide it into:
Hardware/Software and New Technology

Sub categories of different domains and fields. 
Eg: Vision, Graphics, ML, Systems, Networking etc
Graphics: Model generation 
Vision: 
Systems: Light Field Cameras

Challenges in immersive 360 degree capture for natural environments:
Reflective challenges in 360 camera capture. Different cameras see different reflections, will the math still be the same. It wonâ€™t be, because we have not considered illumination. 

Filling the holes using AI

Image representations

Viewpoint aware static and dynamic scene recognition
Integration of codecs 
Near sensor ADC
Motivation for SAR or hybrid SAR to single slope ADC( state of the ART)
Reducing computation
