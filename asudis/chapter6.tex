Summarizing the proposed optimizations and future directions.
DRAM-less
Stacked Image Sensors
ADC readout power, Rolling vs global shutter
Abstractions for hardware software co-design
a) How to find out which data to sense, send without the intervention of computationally intensive vision algorithms.
b) How to detect them early in the vision pipeline
c) Data Driven
