1)  Data Flow: Reducing redundant computation and transfer.\newline
	Cause $\Rightarrow$ Effect  \newline
	Cause:\newline
	Temporal frame re-reference(reuse) for motion vector calculation.\newline
	Previous optical flow re-reference for temporal regularization of current optical flow.\newline
	Effect: \newline
	Increased DRAM memory consumption \newline
	Increased Memory Bandwidth \newline
	Increased end-to-end pipeline latency \newline
	Cause: \newline
	Re-computation of entire flow pyramids for each frame. (Pyramids of previous flow, estimated flow on current frame, current gray image, and alpha channel, all in floating point)\newline
	Effect:\newline
	Increasing the number of computations needed for each frame. \newline
	(Differentiating between the background and foreground and motion vector inputs to reduce the computations. background information is available in the form of optical flow correspondence, motion vectors are available from the ISP/motion estimation block)\newline
	
2)  Data abstractions and formats?
	When and where should we find motion vectors?
	How much is size of local buffers at each stage? Make analytical producer consumer model?
	How much energy saving at ADC readout?
	How much savings because of DRAM organization? and bit quantization?
